# AV-Datapacks
AlmostVanilla data packs

## Overview
AlmostVanilla strives to preserve the core gameplay elements of Vanilla Survival, while make small improvements (especially for multiplayer servers) where possible. Click [here][website] for more detailed information about each pack.

## Installation
1. Select `Clone or download â–¼` button and download as a ZIP
2. Unzip and delete the packs you don't want. Do not delete `AV-Core`, as all other packs rely on it.
3. Copy the AV- folders to the `datapacks` folder within the world folder (for singleplayer, these can be found in `%AppData%/Roaming/.minecraft/saves/`)
4. Restart the world, or run `/reload`
5. You should see a confirmation message listing all the AlmostVanilla packs you've successfully added!
